# PGFPlotsEdt Help

## Introduction

[PGFPlots](https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgfplots) is a remarkable tool for creating high-quality statistical graphs in $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$, developed by Dr. Christian FeuersÃ¤nger based on [PGF/TikZ](https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf). Since the popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, it has been increasingly used by researchers as a code-based medium for creating plots. However, many people are still hesitant to apply PGFPlots to their daily work due to its extensive 500-page [documentation](https://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/contrib/pgfplots/doc/pgfplots.pdf) or the frequent inquiries to ChatGPT.

PGFPlotsEdt: a PGFPlots statistic graph interactive editor, is a better entry tool for PGFPlots. It also offers faster compilation speed and provides stronger data privacy, helping users faster to PGFPlot in $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$.

**Better entry tool**: PGFPlotsEdt presents the main features of PGFPlots clearly through a graphical user interface. You can customize your statistical graph code using familiar modular graphical options.

![PGFPlotsEdt home page](figs/home.jpg)

**Faster compilation speed**: PGFPlotsEdt server, with the help of [mylatexformat](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/mylatexformat) caching technology [^1], allows you to test $\mathrm{\TeX}$ code faster. With moderate $\mathrm{\TeX}$ file lengths, it can achieve compilation speed in near real-time[^2].

![PGFPlots benchmark](figs/avg.png)

[^1]: It is based on $\varepsilon-\mathrm{\TeX}$ engine. Acknowledge David Carlisle for the Chinese caching support method in the XeLaTeX program.

[^2]: Local deployment is required. Real-time performance requires the use of the pdfLaTeX compiler. See [pgfplots-benchmark](https://github.com/LogCreative/pgfplots-benchmark) repo for details.

**Stronger data privacy**: PGFPlotsEdt can be deployed locally, allowing it to run without internet connections, thus protecting privacy and avoiding the risk of data leakage to online tools. PGFPlotsEdt also includes a deployment solution for [Llama3](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/), which provides code insights using a local large language model[^3].

[^3]: Local deployment of the Llama3-8b model requires at least 6GB of available VRAM.

## Getting Started

You can quickly experience PGFPlotsEdt through the following website:

> [https://logcreative.github.io/PGFPlotsEdt](https://logcreative.github.io/PGFPlotsEdt)

The interface of PGFPlotsEdt consists of four main parts: the navigation bar at the top, the preview area on the left, the data area in the middle, and the code area on the right.

![Interface layout](figs/interface.png)

### Compilation Area
You can directly click the "Compile" button in the preview area to view the compilation result of the current chart. At this point, the result should only contain coordinate axes.

![Compilation result](figs/compile.png)

### Data Area
You can hover over the "+ Series" button in the data area and then click one of the data types: function, coordinate, or table. For example, after selecting the "function" type, you can see that a data series is generated, and you can enter an expression in the "function(x)" input box, such as `x/2`. When you are typing, you can see the mathematical formula $\frac{x}{2}$ is previewed automatically on the left.

![Data series](figs/function.png)

### Code Area
After entering the data, you can see that the code in the code area is also updated, with a black block marking the last modified position. You can click the "Compile" button again to view the compilation result. If you are satisfied, you can click the first button in the code selection title bar to copy the PGFPlots code to the clipboard, and then you can insert it into your $\mathrm{\TeX}$ file[^4]; or you can download the PDF from the preview area and insert it into your $\mathrm{\TeX}$ file as an image[^5].

![Code copy](figs/code.png)

[^4]: You need to load the necessary packages in the preamble of your own file.

[^5]: It is recommended to click the "Copy all code" button (the second button in the Code area) to save the plot code next to the PDF file for later use.

Congratulations! You have generated your first statistical graph using PGFPlotsEdt!

### Navigation Area
There is one more area! Hover over the navigation area to see some presets of statistical graphs. Hover over the corresponding button to see the graph preview, and click the button to add it to the data. You can modify the related data in the template to plug-and-play. To learn more about how to implement and customize their styles, see the advanced documentation for details.

### Code Structure

PGFPlotsEdt provides options to adjust the code structure that conforms to the original PGFPlots code. To better understand the logic of the interface, let's briefly explore the basic framework of PGFPlots code.

```latex
\documentclass[tikz]{standalone}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\pgfplotsset{compat=newest}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[]
    \addplot [] {x/2};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```

The section before `\begin{document}` on line 4 is called the preamble, which is mainly used to load library code. This part is primarily set in the **Settings** section. The line `\begin{axis}[]` on line 6 represents the plot environment of PGFPlots. The optional parameters here set the style of the entire statistical graph and are mainly set in the **Axis** section. The line `\addplot [] {x/2};` on line 7 represents a function data series. The optional parameters here only affect the style of this data series and are mainly set in the parameter field of each data series in the **Data** section.

### Axis

Click on the "Axis" tab to expand the menu, where you can see the global settings for this statistical graph.

#### Surplus parameters
You can see a text box labeled "surplus parameters" on the first line. "Surplus" refers to the fact that these options will modify global parameters. Clicking on the "surplus parameters" text box will reveal a blue option list below: the first column represents the option name, the second column represents the translated (or explanation) name, and the third column may contain preview symbols.

As you start typing an option, the list will update to show options that match the typed prefix, and the closest match will be highlighted in the blue area. If you are satisfied with the options in the top blue area, you can press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to autocomplete. You will see that a comma (`,`) separator is automatically added.

For certain options, such as `mark`, you will see a `=...` hint on the right side of the top blue area. After pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key, an equal sign (`=`) will be autocompleted, and secondary alternative options will be displayed. You need to further input the secondary option. You can still use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to autocomplete, or you could input the comma (`,`) to finish this option manually.

#### Global Parameters
The options in the "Global Parameters" section can be used to change the general characteristics of the statistical graph. Leave an option blank to use the default value.
##### Axis Type
You can choose between **axis**, **semilogxaxis**, **semilogyaxis**, **loglogaxis**, and **polaraxis** (requires enabling the **polar** in the **Settings** section).
##### Title
You can add your own title within the chart area, which will also update the title of your browser tab.
##### Width
Set the width of the chart area, e.g., `10cm`.
##### Height
Set the height of the chart area, e.g., `5cm`.
##### Fontsize
Set the font size of the chart area. Options include:
- $\text{\tiny tiny}$
- $\text{\scriptsize scriptsize}$
- $\text{\footnotesize footnotesize}$
- $\text{\small small}$
- $\text{\normalsize normalsize}$
- $\text{\large large}$
- $\text{\Large Large}$
- $\text{\LARGE LARGE}$
- $\text{\huge huge}$
- $\text{\Huge Huge}$
##### Grid
Add a grid to the chart area. **major** adds major grid lines, **minor** adds smaller tick marks on the axes, **both** adds both major and minor grid lines, and **none** does not add a grid.
##### Rotation Angle
*Visible only when 3D is enabled* The rotation angles of the coordinate axes in 3D: vertical angle (VA) and horizontal angle (HA). When the rotation angle value changes, the preview area will show the current state of the coordinate axes. You can also quickly change the rotation value by clicking and dragging left or right while holding down the left mouse button in the input text box, when the mouse pointer changes to $\leftrightarrow$.

##### Legend Position
*Visible only when the Legend is enabled* Choose the position of the legend in the chart area: **south west** (bottom left), **south east** (bottom right), **north west** (top left), **north east** (top right), **outer north east** (outside the chart area, top right).

#### X Axis (Y Axis, Z Axis)
For each coordinate axis, you can set certain properties separately.
##### Label
The label for the coordinate axis, displayed next to the axis.
##### Min
The minimum value of the coordinate axis.
##### Max
The maximum value of the coordinate axis.
##### Arrow
The arrow style of the coordinate axis: **box** (default box shape), **top** (arrowhead on top for x-axis, left for y-axis and z-axis), **middle** (middle arrowhead), **bottom** (arrowhead at the bottom for x-axis, **right** for y-axis and z-axis), **none** (no axis displayed).

### Settings

Click on the "Settings" tab to expand the menu, where you will see a series of checkboxes. Clicking on the checkbox next to each option allows you to enable or disable that option.

#### CTeX/CJK

Enable this option when there are Chinese characters in the graph. When the compiler is set to XeLaTeX, enabling this option will use the [`ctex` package](https://mirrors.ctan.org/language/chinese/ctex/ctex.pdf) (recommended); when the compiler is set to pdfLaTeX, enabling this option will use the [CJK package](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/cjk) (specifically, the `CJKutf8` package).

#### Beamer

Enable this option to generate charts suitable for insertion in the `beamer` document class for slides. When enabled, the most noticeable change is that the font changes from serif to sans-serif, consistent with `beamer`. In this mode, other features of the `beamer` document class are also available (such as overlays). For more details, refer to the documentation of the [`standalone` document class](https://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/standalone/standalone.pdf) and the [`beamer` document class](https://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf).

#### Pin

Enable this option to add annotations when adding series. Further details on how to set annotations will be explained in the "Data" section.

#### 3D

Enable this option to add a z-axis to the coordinate system, allowing further customization of the z-axis in the "Axis" and "Data" sections.

#### Legend

Enable this option to allow each data series to have a legend name. The legends will be placed on the chart based on the "Legend Position" setting.

#### Source

Enable this option to add the "source" option when adding series. Table sources are used to reference data files that need to be reused.

#### plotmarks

Enable this option to use the [`plotmarks` TikZ library](https://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/base/doc/pgfmanual.pdf#section.66). When setting the marker type using `mark=`, more options will be available.

#### colorbrewer

Enable this option to use the [`colorbrewer` PGFPlots library](https://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/contrib/pgfplots/doc/pgfplots.pdf#section.5.2). When using options such as `color=`, `draw=`, `fill=`, more color options will be available.

#### colormaps

Enable this option to use the [`colormaps` PGFPlots library](https://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/contrib/pgfplots/doc/pgfplots.pdf#section.5.3). When using the `colormap/` option in supplementary parameters, more gradient options will be available.

#### CMYK

Enable this option to convert the chart colors from RGB format to CMYK format, which is more suitable for color printing.

#### statistics

Enable this option to use the [`statistics` PGFPlots library](https://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/contrib/pgfplots/doc/pgfplots.pdf#section.5.12). This library provides options for creating box plots (`boxplot`) and histograms (`hist`) in the parameters.

#### fillbetween

Enable this option to use the [`fillbetween` PGFPlots library](https://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/contrib/pgfplots/doc/pgfplots.pdf#section.5.7). You can fill the gap between two series using this library. Refer to the PGFPlots package documentation for more details.

#### polar

Enable this option to use the [`polar` PGFPlots library](https://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/contrib/pgfplots/doc/pgfplots.pdf#section.5.10). You can choose the "polaraxis" when selecting the "Type".

#### dateplot

Enable this option to use the [`dateplot` PGFPlots library](https://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/contrib/pgfplots/doc/pgfplots.pdf#section.4.21.2). This allows dates to be used as input. Refer to the PGFPlots package documentation for more details.

### Data
